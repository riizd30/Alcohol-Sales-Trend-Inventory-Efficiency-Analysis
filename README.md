## Introduction
This project focuses on a public liquor sales and inventory movement dataset sourced from Kaggle. Analysis was performed primarily using Excel to explore sales performance, inventory flow, and seasonal patterns. The goal is to understand how product movement translates into actual sales and identify opportunities for improving inventory efficiency and product mix decisions.

## Methodology

### 1. Define Project Goal & Scope
- Identify items with high inventory movement but low sales conversion
- Analyze sales performance by product type and bottle size over time
- Determine seasonal patterns across product categories
- Identify suppliers that consistently contribute to inventory movement
- Examine inventory conversion performance distribution

### 2. Collect & Prepare the Data
- Imported raw CSV into Excel using Power Query
- Corrected data types for date and numeric fields
- Selected relevant columns for time, product, supplier, and sales
- Cleaned product descriptions and extracted bottle size
- Removed records with no sales or inventory movement
- Prepared dataset for Pivot Tables and dashboard creation

### 3. Analyze the Data with Excel
- Compared Retail Transfers vs Retail Sales to identify low conversion items
- Evaluated sales trends by bottle size (Small, Medium, Large)
- Reviewed seasonal patterns from 2018-2020
- Examined supplier performance over time
- Categorized items by inventory conversion (No Movement, Low, High)

## Key Insights
Analysis revealed that over half of the 211,263 SKUs showed no meaningful sales activity. Medium-sized bottles between 500 and 750 ml consistently drove revenue, while large bottles fluctuated due to bulk purchases. Inventory movement did not always align with sales, and only a small portion of SKUs generated significant cash flow. Supplier performance varied, with a few partners contributing most of the inventory activity.

## Impact and Outcome
This analysis provides a framework to prioritize high-conversion items and address underperforming products. It helps improve cash flow, reduce operational overhead, and align inventory with actual demand, enabling more informed decision-making.

## Business Recommendations
Marketing efforts should focus on high-revenue products, distribution should favor best-performing channels, and low-volume or low-margin items should be gradually reduced. Pricing strategies and stock planning can be optimized using historical sales trends.

## Conclusion
Inventory and sales performance must be evaluated together. Examining conversion rates rather than total sales highlights which items actively generate revenue and which tie up capital. The findings provide a practical basis for better inventory management and sustainable decision-making.
